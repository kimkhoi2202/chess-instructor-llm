"""The shipped faithfulness gate + verified fallback, as ONE reusable unit.

This is the single source of truth for the coach's *gated* generation pipeline —
the VERIFY-AND-REGENERATE loop plus the deterministic, engine-derived fallback.
It was previously inlined in :mod:`src.api.server`; extracting it here lets the
HONEST base-vs-tuned evaluation (:mod:`src.eval.honest`) run the base and the
tuned model through **byte-identical** gate + fallback code that ships in the
live coach, so the only variable between the two is the model weights.

Everything here is pure (python-chess + the deterministic verifiers only): no
FastAPI, no model, no engine process. A caller supplies a ``run_fn(system, user)
-> text`` that produces one coaching draft; :func:`run_gate` does the rest:

1. Ask ``run_fn`` for a draft, check every board claim with
   :func:`src.engine.faithfulness_ext.verify_text_ext`; if any is false (or the
   verifier itself raises — we FAIL CLOSED and treat that as not-verified), RE-SAMPLE
   the whole answer (never strip sentences) up to ``max_attempts`` times, keeping
   the first draft that verifies clean AND names a servable sound move. A clean
   draft that names no sound move is NOT served with a swapped-in engine move (that
   would leave the prose recommending one move while the UI shows another); it is
   treated like a failed draft so the whole reply is replaced consistently.
2. If no draft is served within the budget, emit a deterministic explanation built
   only from :func:`src.engine.position_facts.move_facts` — true by construction.
   The move it explains is the MODEL's own attempt-1 (greedy) sound pick when it
   named one (so tier differentiation survives a prose failure and the served move
   matches the greedy move the showcase/eval scores); only if the model named no
   sound move at all do we fall back to the deterministic engine-derived pick.

:mod:`src.api.server` imports the helpers below (and re-exports the historical
``_``-prefixed names it and :mod:`src.demo.app` depend on), so the live pipeline
and the eval cannot silently diverge.

      itself RAISES, the draft is treated as NOT verified (never passed through as
      "truthful"): the loop re-samples and, if nothing survives, serves the verified
      fallback. A verifier hiccup can only make the coach plainer, never less honest.
    * **Move == prose.** A model draft is served only when it verifies clean AND
      names a move that is in the sound pool. If it named no sound move, the WHOLE
      reply is replaced via the verified path — we never keep prose recommending one
      move while swapping only the structured move field to another (that
      contradiction is the "silently substitute only the move" bug).
    * **Preserve the model's move on prose failure.** When no draft is served, the
      fallback explains the MODEL's own attempt-1 (greedy) sound pick if it named
      one — so tier differentiation survives a prose failure and the served move ==
      the greedy move the showcase/eval scores. Only the PROSE is replaced (with
      deterministic, verifiably-true text for that same move). The engine-best
      :func:`pick_fallback_move` is used only when the model named no sound move.

    ``gate_on=False`` is the ungated-measurement mode only (``COACH_FAITHFULNESS_GATE=0``):
